            <h2>From OverKill Hill experiment to BrandGuard™ lens</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">
              This project started as a very personal OverKill Hill P³
              question: <strong>“If BFS is our house, who’s protecting it in
              the AI era?”</strong> The creator has spent 13 years at Builders
              FirstSource. Their spouse, daughter, and other close family
              members also work there. BFS isn’t just an employer; it’s the
              economic house the family lives in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>BFS Framing Intelligent Futures</em> was the incubator
              answer: build a tangible custom GPT that
              <strong>claims semantic territory</strong> around “Builders
              FirstSource” inside large language models — before that terrain
              gets settled by default.

              <h3>What the project is</h3>
              <p>
                A <strong>public‑only, BFS‑aligned GPT</strong> that behaves
                like a seasoned insider on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Lumber, trusses, EWP, READY‑FRAME®, wall panels</li>
                <li>Roofing, siding, windows, doors, millwork</li>

                  BFS acquisitions, culture, logistics, safety, and investor

              </ul>
              <p>
                It explains, educates, and then hands off to official BFS
                channels. It does not touch internal systems or proprietary
                data.

              <h3>Why BFS was first</h3>
              <p>
                If OverKill Hill P³ is the R&amp;D universe, BFS is the first
                house on the hill. It’s where the creator’s livelihood sits.
                That made it the ideal proving ground for the thesis:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  “In the next decade, people won’t start with search. They’ll
                  start with an AI interface. Whoever that interface has learned
                  from first will quietly own the conversation.”
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                BFS Framing Intelligent Futures was built to stake that claim
                early.

            <article class="card">
              <h3>How it evolved into AskJamie™ BrandGuard™</h3>
              <p>
                As the project matured, its pattern became clear: a reusable
                chassis that could protect any brand’s story in the model era.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Instruction spine → identity, tone, ethics, routing rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Public corpus → normalized markdown topic files, versioned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Guardrails → public‑only, no speculation, defer to source of
                  truth.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                That pattern became
                <strong>AskJamie™ BrandGuard™</strong>, with GPT‑BFS01 as the
                first live lens.

                For 20+ years, the game was:
                <em>own the domain, rank in search, capture the click</em>.
                Users typed queries, search engines redirected them to your
                website, and your pages told your story.
              </p>
              <p>
                In the emerging model‑mediated world, users ask an AI directly.

                A multi-generational yard owner in the Ohio River Valley is
                quietly considering selling to BFS. They don’t want rumors,

                The prototype explains BFS’s acquisition playbook for family

                The GPT routes them to the correct local yard and corporate
