            <h2>From OverKill Hill experiment to BrandGuard™ lens</h2>
            <p class="section-intro">
              This project started as a very personal OverKill Hill P³
              question: <strong>“If BFS is our house, who’s protecting it in
              the AI era?”</strong> The creator has spent 13 years at Builders
              FirstSource. Their spouse, daughter, and other close family
              members also work there. BFS isn’t just an employer; it’s the
              economic house the family lives in.
            </p>
            <p>
              <em>BFS Framing Intelligent Futures</em> was the incubator
              answer: build a tangible custom GPT that
              <strong>claims semantic territory</strong> around “Builders
              FirstSource” inside large language models — before that terrain
              gets settled by default.

              <h3>What the project is</h3>
              <p>
                A <strong>public‑only, BFS‑aligned GPT</strong> that behaves
                like a seasoned insider on:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Lumber, trusses, EWP, READY‑FRAME®, wall panels</li>
                <li>Roofing, siding, windows, doors, millwork</li>

              </ul>
              <p>
                It explains, educates, and then hands off to official BFS
                channels. It does not touch internal systems or proprietary
                data.

              <h3>Why BFS was first</h3>
              <p>
                If OverKill Hill P³ is the R&amp;D universe, BFS is the first
                house on the hill. It’s where the creator’s livelihood sits.
                That made it the ideal proving ground for the thesis:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                <p>
                  “In the next decade, people won’t start with search. They’ll
                  start with an AI interface. Whoever that interface has learned
                  from first will quietly own the conversation.”
                </p>
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                BFS Framing Intelligent Futures was built to stake that claim
                early.

            <article class="card">
              <h3>How it evolved into AskJamie™ BrandGuard™</h3>
              <p>
                As the project matured, its pattern became clear: a reusable
                chassis that could protect any brand’s story in the model era.
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Instruction spine → identity, tone, ethics, routing rules.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Public corpus → normalized markdown topic files, versioned.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Guardrails → public‑only, no speculation, defer to source of
                  truth.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                That pattern became
                <strong>AskJamie™ BrandGuard™</strong>, with GPT‑BFS01 as the
                first live lens.

                For 20+ years, the game was:
                <em>own the domain, rank in search, capture the click</em>.
                Users typed queries, search engines redirected them to your
                website, and your pages told your story.

                In the emerging model‑mediated world, users ask an AI directly.

                A multi-generational yard owner in the Ohio River Valley is
                quietly considering selling to BFS. They don’t want rumors,
                panic, or damage if nothing happens.

              <p>
                The prototype explains BFS’s acquisition playbook for family

              <p>
                The GPT routes them to the correct local yard and corporate

              <p>
                The assistant explains BFS as the structural backbone (not the
