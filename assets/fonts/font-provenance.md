# Self-hosted brand fonts

These eleven original WOFF2 files were preserved from the editor commit and verified byte-for-byte against official Google Fonts responses on September 20, 2026. `provenance.json` records the CSS request, exact source URLs, SHA256 values, and pinned license sources. Each family carries its unmodified SIL Open Font License 1.1 text.

Alfa Slab One is static weight 400. DM Sans has a variable `wght` axis from 100 to 1000; JetBrains Mono has a variable `wght` axis from 400 to 800. The inherited filenames contain 400, but those two families are variable fonts. Shared CSS retains the site's requested weights (DM Sans 400/500/600 and JetBrains Mono 400/700). No font binary was converted or modified.

To refresh, review the official Google Fonts CSS and font bytes, update the source manifest and licenses, and validate real font loading and typography in the browser. Do not replace a file merely to match a hash. Runtime font URLs are root-relative so the live-edge verifier checks their MIME types. The release allowlist ships WOFF2 files and accompanying license text; authoring provenance stays in the repository.
