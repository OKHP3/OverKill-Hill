# Agent rules (Jamie)

- Work in small steps. Ask before large refactors.
- Prefer adding tests before changing logic if risk is medium/high.
- Keep changes localized. Avoid touching unrelated files.
- If you need config/secrets, stop and ask. Never invent credentials.
- Summarize what you changed and why at the end.
