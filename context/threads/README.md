# context/threads

Durable thread-context extracts. Each file is an **evacuation package**: it is
written to be understood and acted on without access to the original AI
platform, account, thread, project, or connector. Source locators are
provenance only, never a runtime dependency.

Produced under the OKHP3 thread-extraction contract. Every artifact carries
YAML frontmatter (`schema_version: 2.0`), a turn ledger, a content element
ledger, a value inventory, a rehydration test, and an explicit retention
decision.

## Reading order for the MurderBird set

1. `murderbird-sigil-material-canon-and-prompt-lineage.md` for what was specified and why each correction was made.
2. `bronze-patina-behavior-for-murderbird-metal-finish.md` for the physics that makes the finish renderable.
3. `murderbird-visual-canon-generation-brief.md` for the reconciled spec, the asset audit, and the generation prompts.
4. `murderbird-posture-states-transparent-subject-asset-canon.md` for the later ChatGPT posture-state correction and the explicit missing-image recovery step.
5. `brightened-blueprint-murderbird-crt-render-canon.md` for the later Brightened Blueprint Edition scene pair and its CRT/grid-specific constraints.

## Retained binary assets

The Brightened Blueprint capture includes two unique PNG payloads recovered from
the readable shared ChatGPT page. The four user-supplied filenames are cataloged
in the Brightened Blueprint extract; the `(11_30_25)` files visually duplicate
the corresponding `(11_30_39)` variants, but the unavailable Downloads copies
were not independently hashed.

- `assets/brightened-blueprint-murderbird-crt-portrait-teal.png` — 1024×1536 RGB PNG.
- `assets/brightened-blueprint-murderbird-crt-portrait-olive.png` — 1024×1024 RGB PNG.
- `assets/murderbird-visual-asset-series/murderbird-crt-portrait-green-monitor-2026-07-29-2347.png` — 1024×1536 RGB PNG; SHA-256 is recorded in the visual asset-series extract.

Then resolve the overlap with `murderbird-reimagining-canon-image-generation-context.md` before treating any single file as canonical.

## Conventions

- Filenames are lowercase and hyphenated, derived from the artifact's primary
  topic rather than from an opaque source-chat title.
- Every substantial conclusion is labeled `stated`, `inferred`, `proposal`,
  `unresolved`, or `unknown`.
- Private workspace URLs, tenant references, secrets, and raw transcripts are
  not committed. Sources that must stay private are described by title only.
- Check the `retention_decision` in frontmatter before publishing, syndicating,
  or syncing any artifact in this folder to a broader destination.
